# Macau client

## Setup

- Prerequisites: [Yarn package manager](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

```
# Clone the repo
git clone git clone git@github.com:room23studios/macau-client.git
cd macau-client

# Install dependencies
yarn

# Start the server
yarn start
```

The app now listens at `http://localhost:3000`, unless the port had been taken before starting the app.
